I am writing to apply for the ``Software Engineer (Remote)'' position at IXL.

My education and my professional background make me a terrific candidate for
this position. I studied both math and computer science for two years at North
Seattle College (cumulative GPA 3.65). There I gained a solid grasp of computer science fundamentals and
object-oriented design via Java, and later Python. 

In addition, I recently completed a rigorous, ten-week course in Python
development. Many coding bootcamps focus exclusively on popular frameworks and
developer tools at the expense of basic computer science theory. The course I
took at Code Fellows, however, placed an emphasis on data structures, basic
algorithms, and object-oriented design. 

Lastly, I have spent a great deal of time independently studying from the classic computer science textbook, \textit{The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs} (see my ongoing progress at {\href{http://michaelstokley.com}{michaelstokley.com}}!). This has enriched, and will continue to enrich, my understanding of functional design patterns, function decomposition, pseudocoding, encapsulation, and recursion.

Altogether, these three avenues of education have provided me with a strong computer
science foundation and excellent programming skills in Python, an object-oriented language.

After completing the course at Code Fellows, I was invited to join Sternshus, a
big data startup in Seattle. : database
schema design, front-end development, ad-hoc shell scripting, API design and
implementation

ad-hoc shell scripting
front-end design work using
database schema design
automation of project file management and with python script and regular expressions
automated the testing of the integrity of arbitrary html files with python
script (idempotent)
implemented an API using Django REST framework


Please consider the following additional qualifications. Having used Debian over
the last four years, I have a good knowledge of Unix systems. At my previous
position as an AR Specialist, I wrote and maintained a library of dozens of SQL
queries, many of which I wrote on-demand for both internal and external
customers. Finally, I have a thorough understanding of the version control
system, Git.

I encourage you to visit my personal
website at {\href{http://michaelstokley.com}{michaelstokley.com}}. There
you can view some of the projects I've been working on, such as a webscraper
that uses breadth-first traversal for fast, reliable results, or a natural
language processing script that turns tweets into poems. You may also be
interested in viewing the final project I worked on at Code Fellows; it's a
full-stack Python web application for recipe sharing and collaboration, built
with Django and PostgreSQL. The site is live at
{\href{http://reciprocity.site.}{http://reciprocity.site}}, and you can view the
source code at {\href{http://github.com/TeamReciprocity/reciprocity}{github.com/TeamReciprocity/reciprocity}}.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to your response.
